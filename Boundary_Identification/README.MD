 1. Run the file **boundary_identification_thesis.py** to get results obtained in thesis.
 2. BondaryIdentification.py will first run active leanring for sampling and then the following file.
 3. This folder contain files obtained after running active learning.
 4. Two epsilon value is used to compare boundary width. The default epsilon value in python file is 0.05. To check 0.1, pass this value to boundary_testcases function. 
 5. Query required from selection strategy is taken from csv file which already contains the result from the BeamNG hence the process will be fast. 
 6. In order to have runtime labels or collect new test results requires vehicle sceanrio files to be run.
